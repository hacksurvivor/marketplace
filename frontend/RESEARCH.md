# Agentic UI/UX Research

To design a "2025-ready" interface, this project draws on emerging best practices for agentic experiences:

- **Conversational Interactions** – allow natural language queries with contextual follow-up, reducing rigid form inputs.
- **Multi-Modal Inputs** – support text, voice, and imagery so users can express needs in the most convenient format.
- **Visible Reasoning Steps** – surface the AI's intermediate steps to build trust and offer insight into how answers are formed.
- **Progressive Disclosure** – start with concise results and let users expand to view sources or detailed analysis.
- **Glassmorphic Aesthetics** – translucent surfaces and subtle gradients create a futuristic yet accessible look, common in award-winning designs.
- **Responsive, Accessible Layouts** – mobile-first design with high contrast and keyboard navigation.

These principles informed the frontend component styles and interactions in this prototype.
